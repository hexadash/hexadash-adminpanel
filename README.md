# Rahele Shirazi

 I coded the following sections

- ## main page 

 Note: When I wrote this section, at first I thought that it would be very easy and I will be done soon and I can help my team, but the result turned out to be wrong, and I ran into bugs many times and wrote from the beginning. 

- ## section filter

 The most difficult part of the story of this part was when I wanted to merge everything together and I worked with flex and put everything together. It was difficult, but I solved it.


 ## Final Note:

 When I wrote this part, it was enjoyable for me, I also ran into bugs, but I solved it.
 section add products.



 # Tahereh Safari

 I coded the following sections

 - ## Header
  The codes of the Header section took more time and I ran into many bugs in the dropdowns, but I was able to solve it.

  - ## Orders

  - ## Carts
  The codes of the Orders and Carts section were simpler and I learned more about working with tables. 

  - ## Footer
> Final Note: The codes of each section were simple but at the same time challenging for me. It took about 4 days to complete all sections.

# Mobin Mahzonzade

 I had two pages in this project, both of which I had to complete, one page for invoices and the second page for sellers.

- ## Invoices page

 I hit this page first
 which took a total of 20 hours, and on this page, I faced many challenges and encountered many bugs.

- ## sellers page

 The second page I hit was this section
 And because this section was similar to the invoices page, maybe it was easy, but it also had its own difficulties, like the challenges and bugs I encountered.
 And this page also took about 17 hours.

 - ## General description
    This project had a very limited time for our project
 For this reason, some sections may not have been well styled, and the challenge I had was working with tables.

# Ali Alavi

 I coded the following sections

 - ## Menu
   The menu part was very easy and did not require much work, but due to the delay in finding the icons, the work was done late
   
- ## Product Details
  This part was the same as the other part of Esun and it took half a day to complete

   - ## Add Product
       This part was very easy and took a whole day
